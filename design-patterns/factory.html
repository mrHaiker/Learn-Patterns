    /**
     The Factory pattern can be especially useful when applied to the following situations:

     When our object or component setup involves a high level of complexity
     When we need to easily generate different instances of objects depending on the environment we are in
     When we're working with many small objects or components that share the same properties
     When composing objects with instances of other objects that need only satisfy an API contract (aka, duck typing) to work. This is useful for decoupling.

    /**

    When Not To Use The Factory Pattern

    When applied to the wrong type of problem, this pattern can introduce an unnecessarily great deal of complexity
    to an application. Unless providing an interface for object creation is a design goal for the library or framework
    we are writing, I would suggest sticking to explicit constructors to avoid the unnecessary overhead.

    Due to the fact that the process of object creation is effectively abstracted behind an interface, this can also
    introduce problems with unit testing depending on just how complex this process might be.
